A simple project illustrating the use of the ArcGIS REST API to compute a distance between two points, obtained from the device's GPS service.

The UI presents 4 output fields and 4 buttons. The output fields are read-only, point coordinates cannot be typed in. They are only specified using the GPS and set using the buttons next to the fields.

The first line displays the GPS status. The button to the right displays the GPS settings.

The second line displays the first point coordinates. The button to the right sets the point value to the current GPS coordinates.

The third line displays the second point coordinates. The button to the right sets the point value to the current GPS coordinates.

And the fourth line displays the computed distance. The button to the right calls the ArcGIS service.
